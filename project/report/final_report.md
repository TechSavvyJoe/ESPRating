- Price and cost inconsistencies triggering business rule violations
- Inadequate error handling and validation in the upload process

Our team implemented a comprehensive solution that addressed these issues through:
1. Robust data validation with detailed issue reporting
2. Intelligent data cleaning and transformation
3. Enhanced error handling with graceful failure modes
4. Partial processing capabilities to handle mixed valid/invalid records
5. Comprehensive testing across standard and edge cases

The solution has been thoroughly tested and verified, achieving a 100% pass rate across all test scenarios. The system now successfully processes both clean and problematic inventory files, providing clear feedback on any issues while still uploading valid records.

## Problem Statement

Mission Ford of Dearborn's vehicle inventory and pricing tool is critical for managing their dealership operations. The system is designed to import vehicle inventory data from Excel exports, process this data against pricing information from cost and retail books, and make it available for sales and management purposes.

### Specific Issues Observed

1. **Upload Failures**: Inventory uploads were consistently failing, with error messages indicating data format issues.
2. **System Crashes**: In some cases, the system would crash when attempting to process certain inventory files.
3. **Missing Inventory**: Successfully uploaded inventory items would sometimes have missing or incorrect information.
4. **Pricing Inconsistencies**: Some inventory items were showing incorrect pricing information after upload.

### Business Impact

These issues had significant business impacts:
- Sales staff couldn't access up-to-date inventory information
- Management couldn't accurately track inventory and pricing
- Manual workarounds were time-consuming and error-prone
- Customer experience was negatively affected by inaccurate inventory information

## Investigation Process

Our investigation followed a structured approach to identify and understand the root causes of the inventory upload issues:

### 1. System Overview Analysis

We began by examining the system architecture and available data files to understand the context:
- Excel inventory export files containing vehicle details
- JSON and PDF pricing information for Ford/Lincoln vehicles
- System interface screenshots showing the inventory management functionality

### 2. Error Pattern Identification

We analyzed error logs and problematic inventory files to identify patterns:
- Data format issues including newline characters in column names
- Mixed data types in critical fields like 'Drivetrain Type' and J.D. Power fields
- Missing values in required fields like 'Price' and 'Drivetrain Type'
- Price below cost scenarios triggering business rule violations

### 3. Code Review

We conducted a thorough review of the code responsible for inventory processing:
- Identified inadequate validation of input data
- Found issues with error handling and exception management
- Discovered problems with data type conversion and field mapping

### 4. Test Case Development

We developed comprehensive test cases to verify our understanding of the issues:
- Standard inventory files (both problematic and correct)
- Edge cases including empty files, missing columns, and special characters
- Mixed valid/invalid records to test partial processing capabilities

## Error Analysis

Our analysis revealed several categories of errors affecting the inventory upload process:

### 1. Data Format Issues

| Issue Type | Frequency | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Mixed Data Types | 3 columns | Columns with inconsistent data types: 'Drivetrain\nType', 'J.D. Power\nTrade In', 'J.D. Power\nRetail Clean' |
| Special Characters | 36 instances | The 'Class' column contains special characters in all entries |
| Newline Characters in Column Names | 3 columns | Column names contain newline characters: 'Drivetrain\nType', 'J.D. Power\nTrade In', 'J.D. Power\nRetail Clean' |

### 2. Missing Values

| Field | Missing Count | Impact |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Drivetrain Type | 1 | May cause validation failures if this is a required field |
| Price | 1 | Critical field for inventory pricing, likely causing upload failures |

### 3. Price and Cost Inconsistencies

| Issue Type | Frequency | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Price Below Cost | 4 instances | Inventory items where the selling price is lower than the unit cost |

### 4. System Integration Issues

The system had integration issues between the inventory data format and the expected format by the upload system, particularly around field mapping and data type expectations.

## Solution Implementation

Our solution addressed the identified issues through a comprehensive approach focusing on validation, processing, and error handling:

### 1. Data Validator Component

We implemented a robust data validator (`data_validator.py`) that:
- Validates inventory data against expected formats and business rules
- Identifies and reports issues by category
- Cleans column names by removing newline characters
- Converts data types to ensure consistency

### 2. Inventory Processor Component

We enhanced the inventory processor (`inventory_processor.py`) to:
- Read and parse inventory files of different formats
- Clean and transform data to meet system requirements
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Generate detailed processing reports

### 3. Upload Handler Component

We improved the upload handler (`upload_handler.py`) to:
- Format data correctly for the upload process
- Handle validation issues gracefully
- Support partial processing of files with mixed valid/invalid records
- Provide clear feedback on upload results

### Key Code Fixes

#### Handling Newline Characters in Column Names

```python
def clean_column_names(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original DataFrame
    cleaned_df = df.copy()
    
    # Create a mapping of old column names to new column names
    column_mapping = {}
    for col in cleaned_df.columns:
        # Replace newline characters with spaces
        new_col = col.replace('\n', ' ')
        column_mapping[col] = new_col
    
    # Rename the columns
    cleaned_df = cleaned_df.rename(columns=column_mapping)
    
    return cleaned_df
```

This function ensures that column names are cleaned of problematic newline characters while preserving their meaning.

#### Converting Data Types

```python
def convert_data_types(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original DataFrame
    converted_df = df.copy()
    
    # Convert columns to their expected types
    for col, expected_type in self.expected_types.items():
        if col in converted_df.columns:
            if expected_type == 'int':
                # Convert to integer, coercing errors to NaN
                converted_df[col] = pd.to_numeric(converted_df[col], errors='coerce')
                # Convert NaN to None for proper handling
                converted_df[col] = converted_df[col].astype('Int64')
            elif expected_type == 'numeric':
                # Convert to float, coercing errors to NaN
                converted_df[col] = pd.to_numeric(converted_df[col], errors='coerce')
    
    return converted_df
```

This function ensures that data types are consistently converted, handling errors gracefully by converting problematic values to NaN.

#### Handling Missing Values

```python
def fix_missing_values(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original DataFrame
    fixed_df = df.copy()
    
    # For Drivetrain Type, fill missing values with 'Unknown'
    if 'Drivetrain Type' in fixed_df.columns:
        fixed_df['Drivetrain Type'] = fixed_df['Drivetrain Type'].fillna('Unknown')
    
    # Don't fill missing values for Price as it's a critical field
    # that should be manually reviewed
    
    # For J.D. Power fields, fill with the median value if numeric
    for col in ['J.D. Power Trade In', 'J.D. Power Retail Clean']:
        if col in fixed_df.columns:
            if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(fixed_df[col]):
                median_value = fixed_df[col].median()
                fixed_df[col] = fixed_df[col].fillna(median_value)
    
    return fixed_df
```

This function handles missing values appropriately, using default values for non-critical fields while preserving missing values in critical fields for manual review.

#### Detecting Price Below Cost

```python
# Check for price below cost
if 'Price' in df.columns and 'Unit Cost' in df.columns:
    # Convert to numeric to ensure proper comparison
    price = pd.to_numeric(df['Price'], errors='coerce')
    cost = pd.to_numeric(df['Unit Cost'], errors='coerce')
    
    # Find rows where price is less than cost
    price_below_cost_mask = (price < cost) & ~price.isnull() & ~cost.isnull()
    if price_below_cost_mask.any():
        issues['price_below_cost'] = df[price_below_cost_mask].index.tolist()
```

This code identifies records where the price is below the cost, which may violate business rules and require manual review.
