    "content": "186 MI Retail  Ford/Lincoln Protect MI Retail Price Book, April 2025 Definition of Terms  Definition of Terms  Commercial   – A vehicle is employed in a Commercial Use if: (a) it is used primarily for business or government purposes, including by an individual or multiple drivers of any government agency or municipality; (b) it is used in a farm, delivery, or construction business; (c) it is designated by the selling Dealer as a vehicle sold for Commercial Use when the sale is reported to the vehicle’s manufacturer. Ford, Lincoln or Mercury vehicles reported sold with delivery codes: “3”, “4”, “6”, “7”, “D”, “E”, “H”, “L”, “M”, “S”, “T”, and “#” are vehicles sold for Commercial Use. When selling Ford Protect, the commercial surcharge will be automatically included on these vehicles.  Note:   For SurfaceCARE, Commercial Use shall refer to any vehicle that is used primarily for business or government purposes, or by an individual or multiple drivers of any government agency or municipality or is designated by the Dealer as a vehicle sold for Commercial Use.  Dealer-Installed Accessories   – Ford Authorized accessories are covered by Ford Protect. Ford   licensed  accessories   ARE NOT   covered by Ford Protect unless the following conditions are met: 1. The accessory is verified to be GFA or FLA 2. The accessory was purchased from a Ford/Lincoln Dealer 3. The accessory was installed by a Ford/Lincoln Dealer (or sublet by the dealer) 4. The component is covered under the terms of the active contract.  Emergency (Ambulance/Fire/Police - except Ford Police) –   The following vehicles must be assessed the SPECIALTY surcharge:  •   Vehicles used in patrol or high-speed pursuit applications (not applicable to Ford Police)  Note:   Vehicles intended for normal municipal fleet use (non-patrol or pursuit applications), but are categorized or equipped as emergency vehicles (i.e., prisoner transports, pool vehicles, fire inspector, fire chief units, etc.) are eligible for all plans. For these vehicle types, only a Commercial Use surcharge needs to be applied.  •   If the vehicle is an ambulance or EMS unit, you must determine applicable coverage based on the vehicle VIN. Is the unit manufactured as an Incomplete vehicle (the first three VIN positions would be 1FC, 1FD, 1F6 and 3FR)  –   If   yes , sell the Cab & Chassis/Cutaway (Incomplete) vehicle plans  – If   no , was the unit manufactured with a 47A package?  » If   yes , sell the plans on pages 9-12 and include the SPECIALTY surcharge  » If   no , sell the plans on pages 9-12, the surcharge is not required  Incomplete Vehicles   – Incomplete vehicles are manufactured to support additional modification. In many instances, these vehicles are known as cutaways, chassis cabs, stake trucks, cherry pickers, and dump trucks, to name a few. Ford Motor Company manufacturers these vehicles with unique vehicle identification number (VIN) designations. On Ford products, these vehicles will have a VIN that starts with one of the following designations.
